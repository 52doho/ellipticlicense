EllipticLicense Static library.
Output: libEllipticLicense.a

NOTE: To use it, after adding libEllipticLicense.a to your project, add -ObjC to Linker Flags in your target/project properties.

NOTE about 10.6: 10.6 SDK broke -ObjC, so use -all_load in Linker Flags.

It uses the same source code as framework (../Framework/)
